            Why Would Anyone Listen to Me?  
        </h2>
        <p>
            I wouldn't. I've been working on being successful in cybersecurity for the past four years. Spent eight years
            in the Army and then used my GI bill to get a master's degree in cybersecurity. I'm actively working on following
            a five year plan that Black Hills Information Security's John Strand wrote. This led me to pursue multiple certifications
            and this course through General Assembly. See the five year plan link below for more info. I'm really interested in the mechanics of the internet
            but am staying far away from Computer Science.

           Training Resources

           Here is a list of solid training resources I've accumulated over the past four years.

       <p>
           The OSI model is a pain in the ass but it's definitely been helpful for me to break down
           areas that I need to study. From my time in the military I was extremely interested in Routing
           and Switching. That led me to work on CCNA from Cisco which I earned at the beginning of 2021.
           I'm hoping to go for CCNP security some time in the next couple years. Check out the routing and 
           switching portion of John Strand's 5 year plan for some great ideas about getting started.
